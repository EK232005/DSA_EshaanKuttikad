Criteria for being an eligible binary tree:
  1- at most 2 children per node
  2- has exactly 1 root node
  3- has exactly 1 path between the root and any node

Traversal methods for binary trees:

A. Depth First Search
  1- Inorder ==> [left -> root -> right]
  2- Preorder ==> [root-> left -> right]
  3- Postorder ==> [left -> right -> root]

B. Breadth First Search
